# Ruby on Rails 4 - Sample App

Sample application from the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com)

## Test Suite

The application uses [Rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) and the [Capybara DSL](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara). 

Instead of following the tutorial's advice to use Spork and Guard, however, it uses only [Spork](https://github.com/sporkrb/spork-rails) for preloading. 

Guard has not been installed in favour of running tests directly in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) editor with the help of the [Sublime RubyTest plugin](https://github.com/maltize/sublime-text-2-ruby-tests).
