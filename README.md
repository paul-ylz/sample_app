# Ruby on Rails 4 - Sample App

Sample application from the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com).
The deployed application can be visited here: [http://morning-beach-8502.herokuapp.com/](http://morning-beach-8502.herokuapp.com/).

## Test Suite

The application uses [Rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) and the [Capybara DSL](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara). 

Instead of installing Guard I opted in favour of [Spork](https://github.com/sporkrb/spork-rails) for preloading and running tests directly in the editor with the help of the [Sublime RubyTest plugin](https://github.com/maltize/sublime-text-2-ruby-tests).
